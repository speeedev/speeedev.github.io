  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I live in Turkey. I am 18 years old. I was introduced to technology with a grey coloured (I never forget this) tube computer when I was 6-7 years old.</p>
  <p>When I was 11 years old, Discord was instrumental in my step into software. I stepped into software with my curiosity about how Discord bots are made. I took part in the founding team of one of the most popular bots in the world.</p>
  <p>At the age of 13-14-15, I was developing desktop applications. In the meantime, I worked with C# and Python. At the age of 16, I started to develop myself for mobile application development, which is the software field I really want. I stepped into this field with Flutter and I still use and praise this technology.</p>
  <p>I am a person who is always hungry to learn, so I am proud of myself because not everyone can have this characteristic. I am also learning SwiftUI to be even better in my profession. I want to reach an important point in this technology.</p>
  <h4>The past and future... <i>(This part is unimportant, don't waste time)</i>
  </h4>
  <p>If a person forgets his past, he cannot determine his future. Since I first stepped on the Internet, I have made many mistakes and achieved important successes. While doing all this, I have not forgotten the people who helped me.</p>
  <p>I do not forget the past so that I can have a good future. There were many people who helped me in my software learning process. These people had an important feature: Love to share information.</p>
  <p>I think I also have this characteristic, so I try to help as much as I can. That's why my favourite saying is ‘he who forgets his past cannot know his future’.</p>
